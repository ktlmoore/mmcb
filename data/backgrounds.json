		"description": "The Nobility and Merchants of Acryn share a number of similarities, they both have immense wealth and connections, although the source of their wealth varies. The nobility have built up their wealth for centuries, and will usually have connections with old groups who have shared in their families fortunes. Merchants will tend to have made most of their money themselves and have contacts with primarily mercantile groups. Of course nothing holds perfectly true, and the figure of a noble whose house has been essentially lost before the revolution and who now rebuilds their house with a merchant enterprise has become a recognisable sight within the city.
